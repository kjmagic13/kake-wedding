At the moment Disney Cruise lines has [suspended departures](https://disneycruise.disney.go.com/guest-services/advisory/) for the Disney Fantasy through September 15, 2020. We realize that there is a very large possibility of our cruise being cancelled as well, if this occurs our plan will be to reschedule the crusie for a future date. If you decide to cancel your journey we completely understand, we encourage you to review Disney's [Cancelation Policy](https://disneycruise.disney.go.com/contracts-terms-safety/terms-conditions/united-states/) as it is time sensitive if you wish to receive a refund.


Thanks<br/>
