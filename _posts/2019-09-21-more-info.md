**Children**

Children are welcome to join us in celebrating aboard the ship; however, due to restrictions on guest capacity we are unable to have children under the age of 17 join us for our ceremony. It is a Disney cruise so there are plenty of fun-filled and supervised activities for your children to take part in!
